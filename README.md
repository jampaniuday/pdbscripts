# pdbscripts
PerformanceDB is a database-driven company, and as our day-to-day database is, we've always developed some scripts that help our staff every day, and we're going to make those scripts available here, because if they help us, with sure will help more DBAs or developers.

[NEW] pdb-get-data-dependency.sh: Checks the dependencies of your data and generates the SQL commands to delete all records.
